# LR_Delivery_Time_Prediction

This project focuses on building a **Linear Regression model** to predict delivery time for the Porter app. The analysis is performed in a **Jupyter Notebook**, and insights are summarized in an accompanying **PDF report**.

## 📁 Project Files

The project ZIP contains the following files:

1. **LR_Delivery_Time_Estimation_Starter_AmitBothe.ipynb** – Jupyter Notebook with complete model building, analysis, and results.
2. **Report_LR_Delivery_Time_Estimation_AmitBothe.pdf** – Summary report covering methodology, findings, and conclusions.
3. **Dataset** – Required data file used for training the model.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Built a **Linear Regression model** using the Porter app delivery dataset.
- Used **Statsmodels** for regression analysis.
- Achieved an **Adjusted R² value of ~0.82** in the first iteration.
- Dropping high VIF variables caused a major drop in model performance, which was avoided due to the predictive nature of the task.

## 🧠 Assumptions

- The dataset is assumed to be **clean**, **non-corrupt**, and in the **correct format**.
- The model is focused on **prediction**, not deep interpretability.

## 🔍 Highlights

- **Code is extensively commented** for better understanding.
- Analytical observations are mentioned after the code/graph blocks using `'''` symbols.
- Intermediate DataFrames are saved to avoid re-running the entire notebook repeatedly, reducing runtime.

## 📝 Subjective Questions

- All subjective questions have been **answered within the notebook** as per the instructions.
- Some symbolic notations might be approximated due to limitations of typing them in code.

## 🚨 Optional Section

- Section 4 was optional; only a few sub-sections were attempted.

## 💬 Note from the Author

> I've done my best to ensure clarity and efficiency in the notebook. While the primary focus was on model performance, I've included observations and justifications wherever relevant.
